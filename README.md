Every design element used in the development of this quiz website testing knowledge of world capitalsÂ has been carefully selected to improve the educational experience and guarantee a visually appealing interface across a range of devices.

A feel that is both complementary and aesthetically pleasing is largely dependent on the color palette. The combination of #9EE493, #805E73, #4E4D5C, and #87BCDE has been selected on coolors.co to achieve a balance between readability and liveliness. The muted purples and grays give depth without overpowering the user, while the earthy tones of green and blue inspire a sense of geography and worldliness. This color scheme not only complements the geographical concept but also fosters a quiet, concentrated space that is ideal for learning.

Lemon, a font notable for its tidy and pleasant appearance, is the one selected. Its simple design and softened edges make it an intuitive interface that is ideal for an instructional platform. Lemon creates content that people feel comfortable interacting with while retaining a feeling of trustworthiness by finding the ideal ratio between friendliness and professionalism.

Recognizing the importance of accessibility, buttons and text have been designed to be larger and easily readable. This deliberate choice ensures that users, regardless of device or age group, can effortlessly navigate through the quiz interface. The increased size not only aids those with visual impairments but also caters to the general user experience, making the interactive elements more intuitive and user-friendly.

Acknowledging the diverse ways users access online content, the mockup has been adapted for phone, tablet, and desktop interfaces. The responsive design ensures a seamless transition between devices, providing a consistent and optimized experience. This thoughtful approach guarantees that learners can engage with the quiz comfortably, whether they are on the go with a mobile device or sitting at a desktop computer for a more immersive experience.
